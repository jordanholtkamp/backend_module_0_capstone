## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
It is something that evaluates to true or false. Ex - 5 == 5 (true), 3 <= 1 (false),
3 > 1 && 2 > 2 (false)

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
You have multiple possible paths depending on user input or a variable, so you want to evaluate at each instance.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if ...
  puts...
elsif...
  puts...
else
  puts...
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
using logical operators. logical and (&&) logical or (||)

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
See the earlier one I did.

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
Not too sure. I looked it up and it looks like case/when statements use conditionals but are pretty similar to if statements.
