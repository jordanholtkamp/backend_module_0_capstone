## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
def hello(suess)
  puts suess
end

say("Sam I am")

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

hello_someone("Sam")

(I didn't know if you really wanted it to print "#{name}", but if you did you would just have to put "#{name}" when you call hello_someone)

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
Oh I thought you wanted me to do this up there. After the method ends, you call it by putting the method name, with what you want to print as the argument. ie - hello_someone("Sam")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?
Not totally clear on what "return" does.
