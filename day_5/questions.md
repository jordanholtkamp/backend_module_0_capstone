1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
It is a way to store data in Ruby, giving a value to each item in the hash, where an array is just a list of elements.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {dog_food: 200, cat_food: 500, goldfish: 175}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
states.keys
states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
Storing yearly wins for a baseball team. You could simply access the amount of wins by searching a specific year.
