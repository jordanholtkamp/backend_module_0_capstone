# Making the Caesar Cipher

1. I would set a variable called "text" to gets.chomp
  1.1 I would puts "What do you want to encrypt?" to the user.
  1.2 This means that whatever text they enter will be a string that is assigned to "text".

2. I would then ask them how many characters they wanted to shift their code.
  2.1 Create a variable called "caesar" and set that equal to gets.chomp.to_i to take whatever number they enter and shift the alphabet that much.

3. Then I would define a method that would take their input, and be able to shift the letters of the alphabet for the string that they entered.

4. Honestly, I am not sure what that method would be, but I think it is a little bit over my head at this point. Pretty confused by this. Not sure how much research I am supposed to do or just try to go off of what we have learned, but I don't think I know a method that we learned to do this. So I guess my next step would be do research on what shifts letters.
